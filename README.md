## About this project
The reason I decided to create this page was focused on **learning** more about *HTML* and *CSS*.
The website was built using the bootstrap@5.2.3 available on [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

## Sections in the website
As a personal portfolio, my focus was to showcase my **HARD** and **SOFT** skills

### Hard skills:
Job-specific abilities or knowledge learned through education, experience, or training. The sections **portfolio** and **work experience** show case my hard skills.
Since I am currently pursuing a postgraduation to gain knowledge in IT, such as project management, data analytics, and web programming, the ideia here is to show how the course is a great complement to the skillsets that I already had in marketing. 

### Soft skills:
Character traits that positively affect how you work or interact with others. The section **About** show case my soft skills. I listed as *Harmony*, *Adaptability*, *Consistency*, *Restorative*, and *Context*. Those are my strenghts mapped using the methodology [CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx)

## Sources 
The bootstrap is a great way to start programming front-end. Take on tutorials online to better understand how to implement the div and the classes.
